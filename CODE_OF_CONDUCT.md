# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of this project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to creating an open, inclusive, and positive environment where DevOps, Cloud, and SRE engineers can collaborate, share knowledge, and build automation tools that help others succeed in their careers.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and empathetic toward other participants  
- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Offering constructive feedback and accepting criticism gracefully  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing appreciation for others’ contributions  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances  
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks  
- Public or private harassment  
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission  
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including issues, pull requests, discussions, and direct interactions — as well as in public spaces when individuals are representing the project or its community.

Examples of representing the project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at **[your_email@example.com]**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The maintainers are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the reporter and will take appropriate action in response to each incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** – A private, written warning and clarification of expected behavior.  
2. **Warning** – A public warning for continued or repeated inappropriate behavior.  
3. **Temporary Ban** – A temporary removal from participation in project spaces.  
4. **Permanent Ban** – A permanent ban from all project interactions and contributions.
